# SARAMSH

Saramsh is a simple text summarization package, developed as a part of my major project in Btech (Computer science and engineering) @Vardhaman college of engineering. The package uses TF-IDF scoring mechanism to score the sentences and thus retreiving important sentences (Extractive text summarization).
